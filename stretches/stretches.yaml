- &walkout Hand Walkout - Set of 6:70

# Squeeze the heck out of your butt of the leg that’s behind you. To enhance this stretch, raise the hand of the stretched hip to the ceiling. If you can't "feel" your butt contracting, try tapping it with your fingers or squeezing it.

# Plank: Your posture should be perfect and your knees should have a very slight
# bend in them. You abs should be tight with a slight arch in the lower back and
# the butt should be squeezed. Imagine you have a coin between your cheeks and it
# should not drop. Squeeze the butt hard and that’s 50% of your problems solved
# right there. I cannot stress the importance of torso stability enough.
